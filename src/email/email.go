						"For years, the prevailing fantasy strategy was to take stud Running Backs early, Wide Receivers in the middle rounds, and then a QB late. Back then, early round QB's were not very valuable, so the strategy made sense.",
						"However, with week 1 in the books we saw more first and second round Running Backs bust (or be average) compared to their Wide Receiver counterparts. We also saw early round QB's (with the exception of Jalen Hurts) dominate their matches.",
						"So does this mean that the early round RB strategy is dead? Maybe.",
						"Should the trend continue, more Wide Receivers will be drafted in the first and second rounds of next year's draft than Running Backs. We already saw a first round that was fairly split between WR and RB this year, could it end up becoming 75% WR next year?",
						"At the current moment it is too early to tell, but the writing could be on the wall for the early Running Back strategy.",
